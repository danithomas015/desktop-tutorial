              <h2>'PowerGlove' Computer Accessory</h2>
              <p>The PowerGlove was a computer interface device manufactured by Mattel under license from Abrams-Gentile Entertainment Inc. It was marketed as an input device for the Nintendo Entertainment System, which could replace a joystick or keyboard commands for use with games. The device was recognized by hackers and garage Virtual Environment buffs as an affordable alternative to other expensive gloves. The PowerGlove used analogue flex sensors and ultrasonics to measure finger bending and hand orientation and position with a precision of up to 8mm.</p>

              <h2>The SEGA Master System</h2>
              <p>The SEGA Master System, released in 1985, was SEGA's first internationally marketed and distributed console, designed to compete with Nintendo's popular Entertainment System. The console introduced technological innovations such as improved 8-bit graphics, directional pads on controllers, sprite scaling, and higher quality sounds. The SegaScope 3-D Glasses, developed by Mark Cerny, were also released for exclusive titles. Games were played through their own ROM cartridge known as a Sega Card. Quality control for games was introduced to address the saturation of low-quality games and consoles that led to the video game crash of 1983-85 in the United States. The Master System sold over 10 million units globally and paved the way for the industry's return in Western markets.</p>

                <h2>3D Glasses Accessory for SEGA Master System</h2>
                <p>The SegaScope 3-D Glasses were a set of LCD shutter glasses released by Sega in 1987, which were used to play the exclusive title Zaxxon 3-D on the Sega Master System console. The glasses were made of black plastic and had thick lenses, with a lead connecting them to the console. The Read Only Memory was a separate black plastic box that plugged into the console to configure the glasses. Zaxxon 3-D came as a cartridge and was sold in a cardboard box labelled "SegaScope 3-D, Zaxxon 3-D, A 3-D Cartridge."</p>
