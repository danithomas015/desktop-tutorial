              <h2>Game and Watch Series</h2>
              <p>The Game and Watch series from Nintendo was a successful line of handheld electronic games that generated enough profit to help the company research and develop the NES and Gameboy. These monochrome LCD games had themed tasks and a balance between achievable outcomes and difficulty, making them enjoyable to play repeatedly. The Game and Watch series broke new ground in electronics applied to toys and helped Nintendo establish dominance in the competitive electronic game industry.

              <h2>Game Boy</h2>
              <p>The Game Boy, released in 1989 and continued production until 1998, became the most popular game console in history, selling over 64 million units. The decision to bundle Tetris with every purchase in the USA and other countries contributed to its success. It became a wearable accessory and was used by individuals in public and private spaces. Despite the superior graphics and processing capabilities of other mobile game consoles, such as the NEC TurboExpress, Sega Game Gear, and SNK Neo Geo, the Game Boy remained the clear winner due to factors such as cost, available applications, and third-party support. The electronic game industry has had a significant impact on other mediums, and its social impact is evident through fashion and health. The industry has demonstrated constant innovation in interface design and delivery media, including wireless devices such as mobile phones and Cybikos.</p>

                <h2>Commodore 64 Computer System</h2>
                <p>The Commodore 64 was released in 1982 and is an important step in computing history, popularising the uptake of the home personal computer. It was one of the most affordable computers on the market and made computing accessible and fun. It sold over 17 million units between 1982 and 1993, making it the world's best-selling home computer of that time, and outsold both IBM clones and Apple computers. Commodore, the company behind the computer, was founded in the mid-1950s and began by selling and repairing typewriters before moving on to calculators and microchips. The Commodore 64 is still popular today and has been the subject of many emulations.</p>
