              <h2>Atari CX2600 VCS</h2>
              <p>Atari CX2600 VCS was a highly successful home entertainment system that set the trend for future developments in the field. It was designed to counter the rapid redundancy experienced by dedicated console products like Pong by creating a flexible system that accepted carts with program information for a game. Sales were initially poor, but were greatly boosted when Atari licensed exclusive rights to produce a home version of the popular video arcade game "Space Invaders". The Atari 2600 console was discontinued in 1991, but its continued appeal may be attributed to several factors including the compelling nature of some of the games, the "vintage" nature of the graphic style and the ability to play "classic" arcade games..</p>

              <p>he Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) revolutionized video gaming in the mid-late 1980s by reestablishing Nintendo with a new business model for third-party developers after a crash in the video game market from 1983-85.

The console had a library of games, including popular titles like "Astrosmash" and "Utopia."
